# VTour
## Inspiration
Because of COVID-19, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html) recommends avoiding travel, so everyone has been stuck at home. However, traveling is a fun experience that transports you to another world, so we really miss it. Hence, the idea came to create a simple, free way to virtually travel.

## What it does
VTour website will present you a new way to travel around the world at your home. What you need to do is to log-in our website, say where you want to go and then scan the AR code to enjoy the virtual tour and play around with the 3D model for landmarks or sightseeings in different countries.

## How we built it
We used Figma to create the working prototype and design of our website. We used echoAR to create the model of our 3D monument.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team was full of beginners and people who weren't too familiar with coding, so it was a challenge figuring out how to actually create the website and make its user interface look good. We eventually settled on using Figma to prototype the website, but there was definitely a learning curve with figuring out how to use it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a really cool website called VTour and we incorporated the AR (as QR code) into it and it works out well.

## What we learned
We were open to learning different things that we never encountered before, such as augmented reality is a new thing for all of us. Also, we learnt that communication is the key for a successful and effective teamwork. 

## What's next for V Tour
We created a prototype for the website through Figma, but we want to make VTour into a working website soon. We also want to add more places in different countries.
